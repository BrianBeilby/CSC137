### Lab 2: Assembler and Simulator for FISC CPU
- **Objective:** Build an assembler in Java and a CPU simulator in Logisim for a simple Fixed Instruction Set Computer (FISC).
- **Features:**
  - **Assembler:** Developed in Java, translates assembly language into machine code.
  - **Simulator:** Implemented in Logisim, simulates the execution of machine code on a FISC architecture.
- **Technologies Used:** Java, Logisim.

### Lab 3: MISC CPU Design
- **Objective:** Design a Minimal Instruction Set Computer (MISC) in Logisim which supports 13 different instructions.
- **Features:**
  - **4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA):** Optimizes the computation speed by reducing the carry propagation delay.
  - **Register File:** Manages the registers used by the CPU.
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs all arithmetic and logical operations.
  - **Controller:** Directs the operation of the CPU based on decoded instructions.
  - **Display Decoder:** Decodes outputs for display purposes.
- **Technologies Used:** Logisim.
